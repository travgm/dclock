This was mostly created for my own edification. This takes a simple calculation converting system time 
to usable decimal minutes left in the day. I wanted to utilize the machines package to create a nice 
compositional monadic pipeline and learn some new concepts.

Here is a blog post on the creation and explanation of it: [dclock in haskell](https://hexproof.sh/2024/10/22/dclock-in-haskell/)

Usage
=====

```
$ cabal run
Decimal time: 292
