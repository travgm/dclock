This was mostly created for my own edification and learning in haskell. This takes a simple calculation converting
system time to usable decimal minutes left in the day. I wanted to utilize the machines package to create a nice compositional monadic pipeline and learn some new concepts.

Usage
=====

```
$ cabal run
Decimal time: 292
$
```
